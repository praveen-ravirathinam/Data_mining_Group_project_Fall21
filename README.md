This group project is a conjoint effort on evaluating the performance and accuracy of various classification algorithms to provide rainfall predictions, based on different weather parameters. Through this experimentative effort, we modelled multiple classification algorithms and tested their model accuracies to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not.
